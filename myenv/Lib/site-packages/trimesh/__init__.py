------------------------------------

Trimesh is a pure Python (2.7- 3.3+) library for loading and using triangular
meshes with an emphasis on watertight meshes. The goal of the library is to
provide a fully featured Trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation
and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in the Shapely library.
