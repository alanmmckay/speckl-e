# Repo structure

## Usage

Send and receive data from a Speckle Server with `operations`, interact with the Speckle API with the `SpeckleClient`, create and extend your own custom Speckle Objects with `Base`, and more!

Head to the [**üìö specklepy docs**](https://speckle.guide/dev/python.html) for more information and usage examples.

## Developing & Debugging

### Installation

This project uses python-poetry for dependency management, make sure you follow the official [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to get poetry.

To bootstrap the project environment run `$ poetry install`. This will create a new virtual-env for the project and install both the package and dev dependencies.

If this is your first time using poetry and you're used to creating your venvs within the project directory, run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` to configure poetry to do the same.

To execute any python script run `$ poetry run python my_script.py`

> Alternatively you may roll your own virtual-env with either venv, virtualenv, pyenv-virtualenv etc. Poetry will play along an recognize if it is invoked from inside a virtual environment.

### Style guide

All our repo  wide styling linting and other rules are checked and enforced by `pre-commit`, which is included in the dev dependencies.
It is recommended to set up `pre-commit` after installing the dependencies by running `$ pre-commit install`.
Commiting code that doesn't adhere to the given rules, will fail the checks in our CI system.

### Local Data Paths

It may be helpful to know where the local accounts and object cache dbs are stored. Depending on on your OS, you can find the dbs at:
- Windows: `APPDATA` or `<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Speckle`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or by default `~/.local/share/Speckle`
- Mac: `~/.config/Speckle`
